# Omnitrix For Pokemon
Ever been a big fan of Pokemon and Ben 10? I am! Here's a little project I'm currently working on - making an omnitrix web-app for view pokemon. Essentially an omnitrix-themed pokedex!

# The idea
So far, I have used GSAP to create a rotating draggable component (the omnitrix wheel) to turn the omnitrix. 
I need to store the state of rotation in a state created using react's useState hook. The image will change based on the state of the draggable component.

**This project is currently in progress, but you may view what we have so far!**

# What's next?
- Make images load before the render
- Do something when you "transform"
