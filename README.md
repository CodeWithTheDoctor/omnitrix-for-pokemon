# Omnitrix For Pokemon
Ever been a big fan of Pokemon and Ben 10? I am! Here's a little project I'm currently working on - making an omnitrix web-app for view pokemon. Essentially an omnitrix-themed pokedex!

**This project is currently in progress, and is not ready to be viewed just yet!**

# The idea
So far, I have used GSAP to create a rotating draggable component (the omnitrix wheel) to turn the omnitrix. 
I need to store the state of rotation in a state created using react's useState hook. The image will change based on the state of the draggable component.
